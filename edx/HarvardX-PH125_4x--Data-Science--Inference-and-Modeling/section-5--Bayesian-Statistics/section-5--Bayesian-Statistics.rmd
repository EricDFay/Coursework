# Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
Suppose the rate of SIDS is 1 in 8,500.
Define

+ $A$ to be `Sally Clark's **first** born infant dies of SIDS'
+ $B$ to be `Sally Clark's **second** born infant dies of SIDS'

Then the probabilities for either infanty dieing of SIDS (given no additional information) are equal
$\mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(B)$.
```{r}
1/850
```
Which is a probability of approximately 0.12%.

When we know Sally's first infant dies this changes the probability of the second infant. Since we beilve SIDS has a gentic link, $A$ and $B$ are not independent. Therefore  $\mathbb{P}(A \land B) \neq \mathbb{P}(A)\cdot\mathbb{P}(B)$
and we must use Baye's theorem to find the conditional probability.

$$\mathbb{P}(B|A) = \frac{ \mathbb{P}(A|B)\cdot\mathbb{P}(B) }{\mathbb{P}(A)} $$
